# DRL_CW2
Coursework 2 for Udacity DRL Nanodegree

## Project details 
This project is completed in the `Reacher` environment, where the objective is to an arm (or 20 at a time) in space to 
follow a provided moving target and stay within the target zone. The agent is given a reward for every time step that 
its "hand" is in the target zone. The environment I used to train the agent was a copy of 20 identical arms, to allow 
for parallel learning. 

## Getting started
To run this project, all that is required is the `Reacher2.app` directory provided by Udacity. This 
directory should be placed unzipped alongside the files within this project. Once this is complete, you can look at or 
run (takes a LONG time) the cells in `testing.ipynb` to check the outputs of miscellaneous hyperparameter tests and the 
code that trained and saved the final agent, or just the last section to see the trained agent in action. To view
the final report and results, you can open the `Report.ipynb` notebook.
